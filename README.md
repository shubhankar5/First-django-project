Django user login and profile app

* User authentication
* User profile setup and update
* User password reset using gmail account
* Admin page


#### NOTE: Add a migrations folder and a file __init__.py within it in the users folder. This has to be done cause django doesn't create this file while migrations and due to this missing file and folder, the tables might not be created.
